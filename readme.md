# 🚀 Seeking Code Optimization Wizard 🧙‍♂️

Hey there, fellow developers! 👋 I've been working on a Telegram bot using aiogram3, and I'm amazed by what this framework can do. However, my `handlers.py` has started to look like a labyrinth of code. 😅

I believe there must be more efficient ways to structure and optimize my code. If you're a seasoned aiogram developer or just a code optimization enthusiast, I'd love to hear your thoughts and tips on how I can make my code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

Feel free to take a look at my `handlers.py`, and if you have any suggestions, code snippets, or just some wisdom to share, please drop them here. I'm eager to learn and improve!

Your help will be greatly appreciated, and I promise to credit you as the Code Optimization Wizard in my project. 🙌 Thanks in advance for your support! 🚀🔮
